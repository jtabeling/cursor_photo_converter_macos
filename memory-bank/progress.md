# Progress

## Current Status

*   **Phase:** Production Ready
*   **Date:** 2025-10-21
*   **Latest Update:** 2025-10-21 - Merged logging system and concurrency fixes into main branch
*   **Branch:** `main`

## What Works

*   Initial Memory Bank structure created.
*   Xcode Project (`Photo Converter`) setup with SwiftUI.
*   Unrestricted media selection from macOS Photos Library using `PhotosPicker` (any photos and videos).
*   Output folder selection using `.fileImporter` with security-scoped bookmarks.
*   Core conversion process (`ConversionService`):
    *   Image conversion from various formats (HEIC, JPG, PNG, etc.) to JPG using `ImageIO`.
    *   Video conversion from various formats (MOV, MP4, etc.) to MOV.
    *   Extraction of creation date for filename generation (`YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.jpg` or `.mov`).
    *   Preservation of existing metadata (including GPS, camera type) for both images and videos.
    *   Update of EXIF `DateTimeOriginal` tag to match original capture date for images.
    *   For images: Setting IPTC `ObjectName` and TIFF `ImageDescription` metadata to match the filename (without extension).
    *   For videos: Updating QuickTime title metadata to match the filename (without extension).
    *   Update of file system creation/modification dates to match original capture date.
    *   Saving converted files to the selected output folder.
    *   Overwriting of existing files with the same name.
    *   Handling of multiple files concurrently using `TaskGroup`.
*   Video Processing:
    *   Primary method using `PHAssetResource` for direct export (preserves most metadata).
    *   Fallback method using `AVAssetExportSession` when direct method fails.
    *   Both methods preserve and update metadata like title, creation date, and GPS data.
*   Basic UI (`ContentView`) integration:
    *   Displaying selected photo count and output folder.
    *   Initiating conversion.
    *   Displaying progress (`ProgressView`).
    *   Displaying status messages and error summaries in a list.
    *   Handling basic error scenarios (e.g., missing permissions, invalid output folder) and skipping problematic files during batch conversion.
*   Application launches and runs successfully after resolving configuration issues.
*   Consistent handling of title metadata across both images and videos, ensuring the media title matches the file name.
*   **Version Control & GitHub Integration:**
    *   Local git repository initialized with proper .gitignore configuration.
    *   Comprehensive .gitignore file excluding build artifacts, user data, and development files.
    *   Initial commit made with all project files and descriptive commit message.
    *   GitHub repository created and connected: https://github.com/jtabeling/cursor_photo_converter_macos
    *   Code successfully pushed to GitHub with proper remote origin setup.
    *   Repository ready for collaboration, backup, and version management.
*   **Unrestricted Media Selection:**
    *   Removed filename restrictions (no longer limited to `img*.heic` files)
    *   Removed file type restrictions (accepts any photos and videos)
    *   Updated PhotosPicker to show both images and videos
    *   Simplified selection process - all selected media is immediately accepted
    *   Users can now select any photos (HEIC, JPG, PNG, etc.) and videos (MOV, MP4, etc.) from their Photos Library
*   **Comprehensive Logging System (2025-10-21):**
    *   New `Logger.swift` class with thread-safe logging using NSLock
    *   Immediate file writes with `synchronize()` for crash-resistant debugging
    *   Log files stored in sandbox-safe location: `~/Library/Containers/jerry.Photo-Converter/Data/Library/Application Support/Photo Converter/`
    *   Detailed logging of:
        *   Asset information (dimensions, media type, GPS coordinates, creation dates)
        *   Video resource details (original filename, UTI, resource type)
        *   Export session configurations and metadata counts
        *   Specific error messages with context
    *   Logger initialized at app launch to capture all activity
    *   Log file path displayed to users in completion status
*   **Controlled Concurrency (2025-10-21):**
    *   Limited concurrent asset processing to maximum of 6 at a time
    *   Queue-based processing: new conversions start as previous ones complete
    *   Prevents "Cannot Save" errors from system overload
    *   Significantly improved stability when processing large batches (e.g., 141 videos)
    *   Maintains responsive UI during bulk operations

## What's Left to Build / Refine

*   **Production Monitoring:**
    *   Monitor log files during real-world usage to identify edge cases
    *   Address specific video conversion failures if patterns emerge from logs
*   **Optional Future Enhancements:**
    *   Additional output format support (PNG, TIFF, etc.).
    *   Advanced metadata editing capabilities.
    *   Integration with cloud storage services.
    *   Command-line interface for automation.
    *   User documentation and help system.
*   **Maintenance:**
    *   Regular updates for macOS compatibility.
    *   Framework updates as Apple releases new versions.
    *   Bug fixes based on user feedback.

## Known Issues / Blockers

*   **RESOLVED:** Initial build errors due to incorrect `Info.plist` path in build settings.
*   **RESOLVED:** Launch crashes due to missing file reference for `Info.plist` in the project.
*   **RESOLVED:** Launch crashes due to missing `Photos Library` entitlement.
*   **RESOLVED:** Launch crashes due to missing `CFBundleIdentifier` key in `Info.plist`.
*   **RESOLVED:** GPS metadata not being preserved in converted video files.
*   **RESOLVED:** Camera type metadata not being preserved in converted video files.
*   **IMPLEMENTED:** Image and video titles now match the filename without extension.
*   **COMPLETED:** GitHub repository setup and version control configuration.
*   **RESOLVED (2025-10-21):** Application crashes when processing large batches of videos (141+) due to unlimited concurrent processing causing "Cannot Save" file system errors. Fixed by implementing concurrency limit of 6.
*   **RESOLVED (2025-10-21):** Comprehensive logging system implemented and merged into main branch to diagnose any remaining video conversion failures.
*   **STATUS:** All core functionality stable and production ready. Logging system enables real-time monitoring and debugging of edge cases.
