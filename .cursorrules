# Project Intelligence: Photo Converter

## macOS App Configuration Rules:

1.  **Info.plist is Critical:** Ensure the application target's Build Settings correctly point to the intended `Info.plist` file via the `Info.plist File` setting.
2.  **Info.plist Content:** Verify the `Info.plist` contains essential keys for app launch and permissions, especially:
    *   `CFBundleIdentifier`: Must be present and linked to the value in Target -> General -> Identity.
    *   Permission Usage Descriptions (e.g., `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription`): Required if accessing protected resources.
    *   Standard bundle keys (`CFBundleName`, `CFBundleExecutable`, etc.).
3.  **Info.plist Project Reference:** The `Info.plist` file must be included in the Xcode project structure (visible in the Project Navigator) and have Target Membership checked for the main app target.
4.  **Entitlements for Permissions:** Accessing protected resources like the Photos Library requires *both* the `Info.plist` usage description key *and* the corresponding capability/entitlement added in Target -> Signing & Capabilities (which updates the `.entitlements` file). Check the **App Sandbox** settings.
5.  **Clean Builds:** When encountering persistent configuration or build issues after making changes to `Info.plist`, `.entitlements`, or build settings, perform a **Clean Build Folder** (Product menu) and consider deleting **Derived Data**.

## Development Workflow Notes:

*   Early crashes (debugger fails to attach, logging system fails) often point to fundamental configuration issues (`Info.plist`, entitlements, code signing) rather than logic errors in the main code.
*   Use macOS **Console.app** -> **Crash Reports** to diagnose early launch crashes when Xcode's debugger doesn't provide enough information.

## Project Status & GitHub Integration:

*   **Current Status:** Application is production-ready and fully functional. All core features implemented and tested.
*   **GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/jtabeling/photo_converter_macos
*   **Version Control:** Git repository properly configured with comprehensive .gitignore for macOS/Xcode projects.
*   **Key Features Implemented:**
    *   HEIC to JPG conversion with full metadata preservation (GPS, camera info, etc.)
    *   Video conversion to MOV format with metadata preservation
    *   Organized filename generation based on creation date (YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS format)
    *   Title metadata matching filename for both images and videos
    *   Concurrent processing with progress tracking
    *   Photos Library integration with proper permissions
    *   User-selected output folder with security-scoped access
*   **Architecture:** SwiftUI + ConversionService actor using Swift concurrency for responsive UI and parallel processing.
*   **Memory Bank:** Comprehensive documentation maintained in memory-bank/ directory (excluded from git via .gitignore).
